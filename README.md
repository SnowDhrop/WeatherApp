# Weather App

Weather App is a desktop application that allows you to check the weather for any city in the world of your choice.

It displays the weather condition (sunny, cloudy, snow, etc.), temperature, and wind speed.

It fetches all this data from the open-meteo API, processes it, and presents it to the user.

**You can execute the application with the .jar file located in executable/WeatherAppGUI.jar**
